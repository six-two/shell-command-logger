# Shell command logger (scl)

This program uses the linux `script` and `scriptreplay` commands to record and replay the output of any desired commands.

## Installation

Install via `pip`:
```bash
pip install shell-command-loggger
```

Or install the bleeding edge version from this repository:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/six-two/shell-command-logger
```

## Usage

### Record

To record a command, you just prefix it with `scl`:

```bash
scl ls -1 /
```

You can also create a symlink to log all invocations of a programm automatically:

1. Find/add a writeable directory to the beginning of your $PATH. For example:
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/.bin
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ```
2. Find out, where the `scl` binary is installed:
    ```bash
    $ which scl
    /home/<user>/.local/bin/scl
    ```
3. Create a symlink named the same as your favourite command. The symlink should be in the folder from step 1 and point to the scl binary (path from step 2). For example:
    ```bash
    ln -s /home/<user>/.local/bin/scl ~/.bin/nmap
    ```
4. Logout and log back in and check if the $PATH is set correctly:
    ```bash
    $ echo $PATH
    /home/<user>/.bin:/usr/local/sbin:...
    ```
5. Try to execute your command. You should now see the "Shell Command Logger" outputs:
    ```bash
    $ nmap localhost
    ############################# Shell Command Logger #############################
    # Timestamp : 2022-03-20 13:30:53 GMT
    # User      : <user>@<hostname>
    # Command   : /usr/bin/nmap localhost
    ################################ Process Output ################################
    ...
    ```



### Replay

If you only want to see the final output, just `cat` the `.log` file:

```bash
cat ~/.shell-command-logs/<command>/<timestamp>.log
```

Replay a command (watch output in realtime):

```bash
scl-replay ~/.shell-command-logs/<command>/<timestamp>.log
```

If you want to replay the command on a different system, that does not have `scl-replay` installed, you can also invoke `scriptreplay` directly:

```bash
scriptreplay --log-out ~/.shell-command-logs/<command>/<timestamp>.log --log-timing ~/.shell-command-logs/<command>/<timestamp>.time
```


## TODOs

- Load settings from a config file
- Different replay speeds
- Create a README in the output location, that xeplains how to understand the logs

## Date format
The normal (Gregorian) caledar is not very intuitive.
Thus I have decided to use an alternative date format, that uses the week number and the type of day.
The format is `<YYYY>w<WW><D>` where

- `<YYYY>` is the current year (like `2022`)
- `w` is an indicator, that teh follwoing is a week and not a month
- `<WW>` is the number of the current week. 
- `<D>` is the day type expressed as a letter (`a` -> Monday, `b` -> Tueday, ..., `g` -> Sunday)

For example the Tuesday of the 9th week in 2022 would be written as `2022w09b`.

This format is similar to [ISO 8601 week dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates) (which formats dates like `2022-W092`), but with the following differences:

- The separator between the year and month is `w` instead of `-W` to make the dates shorter (and easier to type)
- Instead of using a number for the day of the week a letter is used.
This should be less confusing and still makes dates sortable by lexicographical order

You can obtain today's date in this format with the following bash command:
```bash
echo $(date +%Gw%V)$(date +%u | tr '[1-7]' '[a-g]')
```
